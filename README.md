# AIRBNB CLONE

## Description of the project

This is a project inspired by the [AirBnb official web application](https://www.airbnb.com/) and it is a project to see how our software engineering skill has come along and how we are able to implement what we've learnt.

In this project, we would use the following tools for building:
1. Python => The console(our command interpreter for C.R.U.D)
2. JSON => For storing users data
--------------- COMING SOON -----------------------
3. MySQL
4. JavaScript
5. Flask
5. HTML & CSS

## Description of the command interpreter:

The command interpreter would be built using Python, which would be responsible for the creation, reading, updating and deletion of users command and activity. 

It is the backend in which every other framework or language meant for functioning would be made upon.

## How to start it

To start the command intepreter follow this easy steps:
1. clone this repo
2. On your terminal, run the `./console.py`
how to use it
To use follow these simple steps:
